Demo: [https://lifeinnumbers.de/](https://lifeinnumbers.de/)

## The idea behind the app
The difficult thing about developing the app was that there is only one Json file for the whole content. The approach was to create as many reusable components as possible to create new calculation pages simply by editing the content in the Json file. So the app represents a mini CMS, where by minimal development of additional components you can create many different pages to calculate certain consumption values in life.
